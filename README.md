This is a very simple modpack, with only over 160 mods loaded and some data packs from the author.

It includes major mods such as Create,Fungal Infection: Spore,Re:Avaritia,ProjectE,Mekanism,YUNG's series,Better Combat,Quark,Dynamic Trees,and Biomes O' Plenty,along with some optimization, prerequisite,and accessory mods.For detailed information,you can refer to the modpack files.

Regarding this modpack,there are no main or side quests.Players are free to play as they wish (just survive).If you want to challenge yourself,try to craft the weapons of Re:Avaritia(you can combine it with ProjectE to make the process easier).

To maintain balance, this modpack has banned some overpowered items and modified the EMC values of some items. However, there may still be some oversights, and you can add to them yourself.

If you feel that the modpack is missing a certain mod or find it "too difficult," you can manually add mods.

You may manually add more mods to optimize this modpack and make it more perfect. You are also free to redistribute it, but please keep the same license and credit my name.
